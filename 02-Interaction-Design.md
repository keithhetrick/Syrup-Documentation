## Define User Interactions

### Knobs and Sliders

### AI Mode Button

- **Function**: Activates AI-based effect recommendations.
- **Interaction**: Click to toggle AI mode.
- **Feedback**: Button illuminates or changes color when active; an overlay or sidebar appears with suggestions.

### Undo Button

- **Function**: Reverts the last action.
- **Interaction**: Click to undo.
- **Feedback**: Brief animation indicating reversal; UI elements revert to previous state.

### 'Syrup' Bottle (If applicable)

- **Function**: Visually indicates the cumulative effect of the applied audio processing.
- **Interaction**: Non-interactive, but reacts to changes in effect parameters.
- **Feedback**: Fills up or empties dynamically based on the intensity of the effects used.

### 'Syrup' Meter

- **Function**: Displays overall intensity of effects.
- **Interaction**: Non-interactive, updates automatically.
- **Feedback**: The meter level rises/falls in accordance with the total effect strength.

## Animations and Transitions

- **Knob/Slider Movement**: Smooth, fluid animation that tracks the mouse movement accurately.
- **AI Mode Activation**: A fade-in/out or glow effect to indicate activation.
- **Undo Action**: A quick fade or flash to symbolize the undo action, with affected controls moving back to their previous positions.
- **'Syrup' Bottle Fill**: (If applicable) Gradual rise/fall of the syrup level with a smooth, liquid-like animation.
- **Parameter Value Pop-ups**: When adjusting knobs/sliders, a small pop-up showing the current value appears, fading in and out smoothly.

## Additional Considerations

- **Responsive Feedback**: Ensure that every user action receives immediate and intuitive visual feedback.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent interaction patterns across similar elements for intuitive use.
- **Accessibility**: Design interactions to be accessible, considering different user capabilities.
